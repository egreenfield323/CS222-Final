Users will be greeted with a list of the the my recent 20 upcoming games that will be releasing.
The user can then scroll through and click on any of the video games to then pull up more details
about the game, like a description, Metacritic rating, and an enlarged picture. If the user would 
like to search for a specific game, then they may click the search button on the left toolbar and 
type in their search. If some games catch the user's eye, they may use the favorites button, a 
thumbs up, and add the game to their favorites page to save for later.
